# Tech Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain with GitHub Pages:

1. Replace `your-custom-domain.com` in the following files with your actual domain:
   - `package.json` (homepage field)
   - `public/CNAME`

2. Make sure your custom domain is configured in your GitHub repository settings under Pages.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the project
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Preserve your custom domain settings

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Resume

The resume file (`Bhuvan Resume.pdf`) is located in the `public/` directory and will be accessible at `your-domain.com/Bhuvan%20Resume.pdf` after deployment.
